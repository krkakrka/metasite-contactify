Metasite interview contactify project

Run `yarn start` to view locally.
Run `yarn build` to create a deployable bundle.

notes:
- Not pixel perfect, because don't have adobe illustrator and inkScape warps various dimensions.
- Assumed the window size would be identical to the image provided, little work on making it responsive.

todo:
- Better 100% height solution.
- flex container should be the one to add flex properties to children.
- Namespaced selectors - can use namespace when styling, not in classname. Would be cleaner.
- tidy css?
- todo add fonts.
